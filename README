These are scripts related to LDAP!

migrate_common.ph/migrate_passwd.pl is a script from
https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/migrationtools hacked up to follow
some CClub conventions. It takes an /etc/passwd file and converts it
into an LDIF, "LDAP Import Format".

add_user.sh takes a single /etc/passwd line as a command line
argument, converts it into an LDIF with migrate_passwd.pl, and then
imports it into the CClub LDAP server. If it isn't passed any
arguments, it will grab the last line from
/afs/club.cc.cmu.edu/service/etc/passwd.user and try importing that.

make_user_admin.sh doesn't exist but should eventually.

delete_user.sh doesn't exist but should eventually.
